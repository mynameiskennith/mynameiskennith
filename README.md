👋 Hello there! I'm Kennith Joseph, a passionate Computer Science and Engineering student at St. Joseph's College of Engineering and Technology Palai. 💻

I'm enthusiastic about web development and love exploring the world of coding in Java, C++, C, and Python. 🌐 My journey in the realm of software engineering has been incredibly exciting, and I'm constantly honing my skills to create efficient and innovative solutions.

In addition to programming, I also have hands-on experience in Adobe Illustrator, Figma, and Photoshop 🎨, which allows me to bring creativity and design flair to my projects.

I'm eager to collaborate, learn, and contribute to the fascinating world of technology. Feel free to explore my repositories and connect with me. Let's build something amazing together! ✨
